abstract = "In the last years many medical researches have reported an increase of health problems in developed countries, mostly related to a sedentary lifestyle (as obesity and linked pathologies like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases). As a consequence. many research efforts have been carried out for finding strategies for motivating people to exercise regularly. In this paper we present an Android-based mobile application, called Everywhere Run [1], that aims at motivating and supporting people during their running activities, behaving as a virtual personal trainer. Everywhere Run fosters the interaction between users and real personal trainers, in order to make it easy to non expert people to start working out in a healthy and safe way."
