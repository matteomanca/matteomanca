title: MoTiV
summary: The MoTiV project addresses Value of Travel Time VTT from the perspective of a single individual with a unique combination of personality, preferences, needs and expectations, in contrast with the traditional viewpoint of the economic dimension (time and cost savings). MoTiV aims at achieving a broader and more interdisciplinary conceptualization and understanding of VTT by emphasizing its behavioural component.

As modern societies have become increasingly mobile, travel time has come to represent one of the largest costs of transportation. As such, theValue of Travel Time (VTT) is one of the most developed research areas within the study of the time cost of travel. 
The role and importance of motivational and behavioural factors in VTT research is well recognised, but current VTT definitions, and methodologies for its assessment and subsequent recommendations, mostly focus on time and cost savings related to the personal “Travel Time Budget” (TTB), the constant amount of time one invests in daily mobility.
A lesser known factor is what the value of travel time means for the end user, in relation to their needs, expectations, and lifestyles: people do not always consider more meaningful or pleasant time that is spent more efficiently or productively.
MoTiV (Mobility and Time Value), an EU Horizon 2020 project, addresses the emerging perspectives on changing VTT. Accordingly, it explores the dynamics of individual preferences, behaviors and lifestyles that influence travel and mobility choices. In other words, what does value of travel time mean for the end user's travel experience?
The MoTiV project addresses VTT from the perspective of a single individual with a unique combination of personality, preferences, needs and expectations, in contrast with the traditional viewpoint of the economic dimension (time and cost savings). MoTiV aims at achieving a broader and more interdisciplinary conceptualization and understanding of VTT by emphasizing its “behavioural” component.
