title: SUPER
summary: SUPER is a EU project that explores a holistic integrated framework for understanding citizens’ reactions against emergencies in social media, while at the same time empowering security forces and civil protection agencies to fully leverage social media in their operations. Social media is often used to report upon ongoing emergencies in real-time from the scene. Indeed, it can be a valuable medium via which important incidents  within a larger event can be reported to the emergency services. SUPER will investigate new approaches to automatically detect emerging incidents using social media as they occur, such that emergency responders can remain up-to-date as the situation changes over time. Large-scale distributed stream processing techniques will be developed in SUPER to detect new incidents relating to an event from bursty high-rate social streams.
